# Zabbix Templates

[Zabbix](https://www.zabbix.com) is an open-source software tool to monitor IT infrastructure such as networks, 
servers, virtual machines, and cloud services. Zabbix collects and displays basic metrics.

This repository is dedicated to templates that are not official and don't duplicate the functionality of templates 
that are created and maintained by [Zabbix community](https://www.zabbix.com/community).

By the way, templates can contain items with keys already implemented in Zabbix, but with a new way of using them.

All templates for Zabbix version: 6.0 and higher.

## Installation

- Download and [import a template](https://www.zabbix.com/documentation/current/manual/xml_export_import/templates#importing) into the supported Zabbix version
- Configure the template according to the configuration requirements
- Configure a host with [template](https://www.zabbix.com/documentation/current/manual/config/templates/template)
